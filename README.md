## Discripton

Frontend webpage with integrated shop. Slide navigation and slide cart menu. Every category, search, cards, register is created with Javascript to ensure no reload is necessary and make the page faster.

When a product is added to the cart the total amount is automatically calculated/updated.
Objects are set to local storage so there is no loss of input if the page is reloaded.

Register form included with regex validation (German inputs required).
